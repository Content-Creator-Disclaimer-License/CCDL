## About the Content Creator Disclaimer and License (CCDL)
CCDL is meant to provide a convenient way for content creators to protect themselves from legal liability that may arise from any consumer of the content they create (a viewer, listener, reader, etc.) using or relying on the content or the information contained in the content. CCDL is intended to function as a disclaimer, create a binding arbitration agreement between content creator and content consumer, and otherwise protect content creators whose content may be widely distributed.

CCDL intends to enhance protection beyond a regular disclaimer by not granting legal permission to consume the content, unless the potential content consumer has agreed to CCDL. This may be useful because the degree to which a disclaimer a person hasn't explicitly agreed-to is effective, is sometimes challenged. CCDL attempts to assist creators by creating a situation where a person who consumes content to their detriment, and without agreeing to the disclaimer, may be found to have done so illegally, thereby resolving the content creator from liability despite the effectiveness of the "disclaimer" clauses contained in CCDL.

CCDL is also an attempt to balance long-windedness, which may detract from the quality of content, with the necessity that content creators, especially those touching on important issues for consumers (health, law, finances), may require protection.

To make CCDL maximxally effective, it is reccomended that at the beginning and end of each piece of content, and at least every 30 minutes or 4000 words, the audience is reminded that:
 * the content is licensed on a limited basis under CCDL
 * the full text of CCDL can be found at ((LOCATION CCDL CAN BE FOUND)), which includes that:
   * the audience must agree to CCDL or they do not have permission to consume the content and should stop listening/watching/reading immediately
   * the content is not meant to be used or relied on without independant verification
   * if important: (1) content to be verified by the audience, and (2) audience is urged to obtain professional advice
