## About the Content Creator Disclaimer and License (CCDL)
CCDL is meant to provide a convenient way for content creators to protect themselves from legal liability that may arise from their audience (a viewer, listener, reader, etc.) using or relying on their content. This sort of liability is especially important in content which provides information designed to help the audience make good decisions (eg. legal, medical, rehabilitation, workout, etc.). CCDL is intended to:
  * function as a disclaimer,
  * create a license whereby the audience may not consume the content without agreeing to the disclaimer,
  * create a binding arbitration agreement between content creator and content consumer, and
  * otherwise protect content creators whose content may be widely distributed.

CCDL intends to enhance protection beyond a regular disclaimer by not granting legal permission to consume the content, unless the potential content consumer has agreed to CCDL. This may be useful because most disclaimers require agreement, and disclaimers are sometimes challenged on the basis that that the disclaimer was not agreed-to (eg. browsewrap agreements). CCDL attempts to assist creators by requiring their audience to either agree to the disclaimer, or gain access to the content illegally. In the latter case, the law may assist the creator through the doctrine of *ex turpi causa non oritur actio* or other means, providing an additional layer of protection - the goal is to create something closer to a clickwrap agreement to enhance the degree of protection of the creator.

CCDL's goal is to assist creators by minimizing long-windedness in adequately achieving the above objectives. Lengthy disclaimers, of course, can detract from the marketability of content. One of the goals of CCDL is to see widespread adoption, such that consumers of content are familiar with the terms.

CCDL is not meant to conflict with other common license types (Creative Commons, GNU GPS, MIT, etc.), but provide an extra layer of  protection which can be embedded in content alongside other common license types geared at the "shareability" or "use" of the content.

To make CCDL maximxally effective, it is reccomended that at the beginning and end of each piece of content, and at least every 30 minutes or 4000 words, the audience is reminded that:
 * the content is licensed on a limited basis under CCDL
 * the full text of CCDL can be found at ((LOCATION CCDL CAN BE FOUND)), which includes that:
   * the audience must agree to CCDL or they do not have permission to consume the content and should stop listening/watching/reading immediately
   * nothing contained in the content is intended as advice
   * the content is not meant to be used or relied on without independant verification
   * if important to the audience: (1) content to be verified by the audience, and (2) audience is urged to obtain professional advice
