Information from Professionals
The Content Providers may include professionals in a particular field, speaking about their area of expertise. For further certainty, and without limiting the generality of anything else herein, the Content should not be used or relied on and it is not authoritative or exhaustive, for the following reasons (Abstract: here are a bunch of good reasons for the other terms in this document):
Things change. The Content may discuss areas which are in flux and of which they can therefore not be certain. The Content may be out of date and a given area discussed by the Content may have changed since the Content was developed.
The Content is not developed with the expectation of reliance on or use of the Content. It instead focuses on conversation and discussion of important points, but should not be expected to provide a thorough or nuanced view of any area. As such, the Content is not issued with the same degree of fastidious, completeness, or accuracy as it might be if there were an expectation of reliance.
On any sort of contentious / important issue, professionals don’t usually know “the answer.” When giving advice, professionals apply their knowledge to a certain set of factual circumstances, using the knowledge and information available to them, to try to reach a positive conclusion for their clients. They manage the perceived risk of various possible courses of action in a given factual matrix, and attempt to manage probabilities in attempting to achieve particular outcomes. Therefore, a professional is usually not certain as to the correct course of action; if the problems resolved by professionals were binary or linear, professionals would not exist in the same form they do today. Professionals render an opinion as to what the best course of action may be, based on what is known of a particular circumstance, subject to change as more information becomes available. In most professional advice, the client’s circumstances are unique to some degree, and so the outcome or correct course can’t be a certainty until the outcome has been reached.
An indispensable part of professional is a ‘conversation’ with the client - the Content does not allow this sort of conversation. A two-way conversation leads to better advice because it gives the advice provider the opportunity to ask questions; verify assumptions; be corrected on misapprehensions in respect of a particular situation; do research; and notice and account for other relevant, potentially related and important issues, which may not have appeared immediately relevant to you; etc. The manner in which the Content is provided does not allow these activities to take place to the degree necessary for advice to be given. The Content is not a substitute for advice.
The Content is designed to be engaging, which will on occasion supercede its desire to be precisely accurate. This may lead to rhetorical devices being employed. For example, there may be catchy headlines, overstatements, understatements, colourful illustrations, etc. It is faster, easier, and more compelling to say “you should do X” as opposed to “people should generally do X.” It should be assumed it is impossible to tell what is a rhetorical device or “artistic license” in phrasing, and what is not. As such, the Content is not a replacement for advice.
As such:
At best, the Content should be seen as aiming to give you a starting point for your own due-diligence, research and decision-making. It is not meant to be authoritative or exhaustive, and unless otherwise noted, is not tailored to real-world situations. 
Before use of or reliance on the Content, you are urged to validate and verify any information gleaned from the Content:
through professional advice,
from at least three other independent sources, or
both.
